# Multi-fiber array (MFA)-based photometry system
This page provides resources for the publication on MFA development

## system
The folder contains an Excel file with a parts list to construct the optical system.

## grids
The folder contains three .stl files and a Python-based FreeCAD macro.

## fabrication
There is a PDF file detailing MFA fabrication procedures.

## MFA image processing workflow
The MATLAB LiveScript is the workflow for processing a .cxd file to analyse photometry signals.

## mfaCTpy: Python-based package for micro-CT image processing
https://github.com/Sakata-Lab/mfaCTpy 

This package allows:
- file conversion from .dicom files to a .tif file
- alignment to the midline
- registration to the Allen CCFv3
- manual tracing of individual fibers
